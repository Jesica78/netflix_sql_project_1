##Overview

 This project is focused on analyzing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using SQL.
The dataset includes details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and duration.
By applying SQL queries, the project extracts valuable insights about the type, distribution, and trends of Netflix content.

Objectives

* Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
* Identify the most common ratings for Movies and TV Shows
* List and analyze content based on release year, country, and duration
* Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords

DataSet 
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset.
