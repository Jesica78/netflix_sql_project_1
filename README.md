Objectives

* Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
* Identify the most common ratings for Movies and TV Shows
* List and analyze content based on release year, country, and duration
* Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords

DataSet 
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset.
